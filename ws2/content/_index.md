## Automating AWS Network Connectivity with Terraform: VPN, Transit Gateway, VPC Peering & Session Manager

### Overview
This workshop focuses on creating a automated AWS network architecture using Terraform to enable secure and efficient connectivity across multiple AWS accounts and regions. 
This design uses AWS networking solutions, including VPN Site-to-Site connections, AWS Transit Gateway, VPC Peering, providing inter-region and multi-account connection. 
Creating secure connection with AWS Systems Manager (Session Manager) and saving the history of sessions to AWS S3.

Terraform is an **open-source** tool developed by HashiCorp for *Infrastructure as Code (IaC)*, which enables users to define and manage cloud infrastructure through 
code rather than manual setup or *point-and-click* interfaces. 
Terraform shortens construction time and supports complex multi-region architecture, so it helps me optimizing my costs when using AWS services.
